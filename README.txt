defect in migraine to spreading depression in a computational model,
PeerJ, 2:e379, http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.379

Purpose: Model spreading depression with an extended Hodgkin-Huxley
framework that includes time-dependend ion concentrations and to
establish a connection between a migraine genotype, namely the
familial hemiplegic migraine type 3 (FHM3), and cellular phenotype of
this disease.
